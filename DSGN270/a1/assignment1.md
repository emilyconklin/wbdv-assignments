# Review of TenTree.ca
## Overview

> TenTree.ca is a sustainable clothing brand that plants **10 trees** for *every* item purchased. 

### User Experience and Usability

I think this website is very usable from a consumer standpoint. The following points cover what TenTree has done in regards to Usability and UX:
- The designers did not bloat the page with walls of text. They use short, catchy sentences to set a tone for the brand, highlight their accomplishments and allow the consumer to decide how much they want to know. 
- Created prominence by utilizing a hero banner, which immediately directs the consumer to which department will best suit their needs (Men's or Women's). 
- The page is broken up into clearly defined areas, and they used alot of negative space to highlight each section. For example: the topics are mostly displayed in a card format, and then surrounded by a white background to make them standout.
- The one thing I found a bit redundant on the homepage was that they had another section for categories underneath the hero banner and accomplishments. The only new addition was an Accessories card. This could have been displayed in the hero banner and I just thought it was a bit of a waste of real estate. It kind of felt like they just put it there for the sake of decoration, or taking up space.
- The devs used top tabs like a hamburger menu, search bar and shopping cart. These are located exactly where you'd expect, and is a convention that most consumers are comfortable with. However, instead of using a traditional shopping cart they use a "planting bag" which is a little creative nod to their mission, and a fun way to break conventions without being too abstract or confusing.
- Loadings times on the website are reasonable, but not immediate. 
- The search bar uses predictive text and shows little avatars of the products, which I think is a pretty cool feature - although, it takes slightly longer than the rest of the content to load.
- They don't force you to subscribe, make an account or give personal information to browse the website.
- I think the heirarchy of the content is well placed, because the products and mission are made the forefront of the design and the rest of content follows in a logical format.
- The nav menu is categorized effectively, and it is easy to find what you are shopping for. The products are showcased well, and the shop itself is well-spaced and uncluttered.
- The Call to Action button is essentially a contact/query button, which will be helpful for users with further questions. There is small to medium sized pop-up that displays the first time you view the site and it gives a small blurb about what the button is for. This could be annoying to some people, but it wasnt a dealbreaker for me.

### Accessibility

I used Chrome DevTools to do an audit on the website and it recieved a 69% accessibility rating. Apparently, some of the background and foreground ratios do not have a sufficient contrast. It also said something about [aria-*] attributes not having valid values. When I looked through the source code it didn't seem to contain any semantic elements, or role attributes so there is room for improvement. I did find a few alt tags, but I didn't find that they were very descriptive. However, they are maintaining a 91% SEO ranking, so despite their issues with accessibilty, they are still quite visible through search engines.

### Mobile Friendliness

The desktop layout transitions smoothly into a mobile display, while maintaining content parity. The mobile version doesn't have a bottom navigation bar, but it has utilized some gestures for swiping through content horizontally, as well as a back-to-top button if needed. When, I audited the mobile Accesibility on Chrome it only got a 54% rating for accesibility so it does lose some of it's effectiveness in that area.

### Content Design

I think the team who worked on this website did a fantastic job of conveying TenTrees brand aesthetic. TenTrees is a slow fashion brand that uses ethically sourced fabric to produce stylish, yet minimalistic designs. Minimalism is already considered a best practice in web design, but the designers overall choice in color schemes, typography and graphics really compliment the feel of the products and company mission. The layout itself follows a very predictable layout structure and the devs didn't really go out of their ways to break the mold with this website, but overall, I found it a functional and attractive presentation.
