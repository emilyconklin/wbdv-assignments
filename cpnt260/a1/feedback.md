- great comments!
- nice menu responsiveness and choice of background image
- `type="css"` in your link tag can be safely omitted in 2020
- all caps text should have normal capitalization; capitalize using `uppercase`. I leave it to you to find the property name.
- the convention for naming containers like `heading-container` is `wrapper`
