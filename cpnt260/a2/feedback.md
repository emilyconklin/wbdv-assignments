- More spacing in your CSS makes it more readable.
- Only one column is needed for this design since all elements are centred on the card. Having no column definitions make the code base smaller.
- Tab length for indetation should be two space
- `strong` tag is inappropriate since it's an inline element and bolds the text (mockup uses normal text). Use `p` tag or similar.
